# Attendance Dashboard Changes

## Revert BambooHR API Integration - May 1, 2025

### Removed
- BambooHR API integration for employee data
  - Removed `bamboo_api.py` module
  - Removed `update_bamboo_data.py` script
- Updated dependencies
  - Removed `requests` package (kept `python-dotenv` for environment variable management)

### Changed
- Reverted to CSV-based data loading for employee information
- The system now exclusively uses local CSV files for all data sources

### Reason for change
- Simplify the data loading process
- Reduce external dependencies
- Make the system more self-contained

## BambooHR API Integration - April 30, 2025

### Added
- BambooHR API integration for employee data
  - New `bamboo_api.py` module for interacting with BambooHR API
  - Added `fetch_bamboohr_data()` function to get employee information and employment history
  - Added `BambooHRClient` class for API interaction
- Update data script
  - New `update_bamboo_data.py` script for updating employee data from BambooHR API
- Updated dependencies
  - Added `python-dotenv` for environment variable management
  - Added `requests` for API calls

### Changed
- Updated `data_ingestion.py` to support API data sources
- Updated `README.md` with instructions for API setup

### Dependencies
- Added `python-dotenv==1.0.0`
- Added `requests==2.31.0`

## Type Error Fix - April 15, 2025

### Issue
The Daily Attendance Lookup tab was failing with the error: `'<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'str'` when attempting to compare employee IDs.

### Root Cause
Employee IDs were being stored and compared with inconsistent types:
- In some places, they were being converted to numeric (float) values
- In other places, they remained as strings
- This inconsistency caused type errors during comparison operations

### Changes Made (Initial Fix)

1. Updated `src/data_analysis/employee_metrics.py`:
   - Added explicit conversion of employee_id to float type in the active_employees DataFrame
   - Added explicit conversion of employee_id to float type in the date_data DataFrame
   - Simplified the comparison logic to avoid type mismatches
   - Added handling for missing 'is_full_time' column

2. Updated `src/dashboard.py`:
   - Added explicit conversion of employee_id to float64 type
   - Added explicit conversion of date_info to pandas Timestamp
   - Added detailed error logging for easier debugging

3. Created new diagnostic tool `diagnose_attendance.py`:
   - Added comprehensive data type checking and diagnostics
   - Added specific testing for the daily attendance lookup functionality
   - Provides detailed logging and error information

## Enhanced Type Handling Fix - April 15, 2025

### Issue
The error persisted despite the initial fixes, indicating deeper type inconsistency issues.

### Additional Changes Made

1. Updated `src/data_analysis/employee_metrics.py`:
   - Added proper logging setup at the module level
   - Implemented more robust date handling with explicit type conversions
   - Separated date comparison operations to ensure consistent types
   - Added fallback comparisons for employee IDs that uses multiple approaches
   - Modified employee ID comparison to use masks instead of direct filtering
   - Used .astype('float64') consistently to ensure predictable numeric types
   - Added try/except blocks with detailed error handling

2. Updated `src/dashboard.py`:
   - Added comprehensive type conversion for ALL potentially problematic columns
   - Standardized string column handling with explicit .astype(str) conversion
   - Added debug logging of data types before function calls
   - Used deep copies to prevent any modification of the original data

### Validation
The diagnostic tool now successfully runs without any type-related errors, confirming:
- All employee_id values are consistently stored as float64 type
- All date comparisons are performed with proper datetime types
- All string comparisons use consistent string types
- The daily attendance lookup function runs without errors
- The function returns the expected data format with correct typing

### Additional Notes
- A warning about the 'is_full_time' column not being found will appear when running diagnostics - this is expected behavior and is handled by assuming all employees are full-time.
- Minor DtypeWarning still appears during CSV loading - this is a pandas warning that can be ignored or fixed by specifying dtype options during load.
